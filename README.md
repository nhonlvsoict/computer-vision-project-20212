- CNNForFaceDetection.ipynb for training CNN model for Face Detection phase
- Preprocessing.ipynb for pipline data through 2 method of Face Detection, preprocess and archieve the data
- [Training_Triplet]_Facedetect.ipynb for training CNN model for Face Recognition phase
- Because lack of facility and huge amount of dataset, we train the model on Google Colab and store all data in Driver
